Web development can be a daunting topic to get started with. Unlike conventional applications, you have to not only be familiar with how the web works, but you also have to understand a variety of technologies and languages. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will teach you everything you need to know to get started with web development. You'll learn how to create web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not only that, but you'll learn about some of the fundamentals of the internet: URLs, DNS, HTTPS and more!
